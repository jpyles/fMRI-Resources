## Useful Websites


* **[fMRI 4 Newbies](http://culhamlab.ssc.uwo.ca/fmri4newbies/)** - Jody Culham's excellent site for intro fMRI info
* **[practiCal fMRI](https://practicalfmri.blogspot.com/)** - Ben Inglis' blog on everything related to MRI physics (especially Siemens magnets) and lots on fMRI practice and other issues. An excellent resource.
* **[NIH MRI Summer Course](https://fmrif.nimh.nih.gov/public/fmri-course)** - A great collection of lecture videos and slides covering many aspects of functional and structural imaging.
* **[MIT Imaging Mindhive](http://mindhive.mit.edu/imaging)** - A wiki of very good information on various aspects of fMRI.
* **[Data Analysis Tips I Wish I'd Known Sooner](http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2014/04/data-analysis-ten-tips-i-wish-id-known.html)** - Not imaging specific, but a good set of tips.


## Software

***Main fMRI Software Packages***

* **[SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/)** - The most widely used fMRI analysis software. Based in Matlab it is powerful and versatile, but has poor visualization capabilities. (From: FIL at Univ. College London)
* **[AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/)** - An excellent and fast Linux/Unix compiled analysis package with scripting capability and good visualization, especially when combined with the SUMA surface analysis package. (From: Medical College of Wisconsin and now based at NIH)
* **[FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki)** - Another excellent Linux/Unix compiled package with good visualization and powerful analysis and scripting capabilities. FSL also is also home to one of the standard diffusion MRI packages. (From: FMRIB, Univ. of Oxford)
* **[BrainVoyager](http://www.brainvoyager.com/)** - A powerful cross platform compiled package with excellent visualization and surface analysis capabilities and an easy to use GUI. Requires a paid license. (From: Rainer Goebel and Brain Innovations, Maastricht, The Netherlands)
* **[FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)** - An analysis package rooted in surface reconstruction. `recon-all` is the standard automatic segmentation routine for many researchers, even if they analyze their data in other packages. (From: The Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging and the Martinos Center at MGH)
* **[MrVista](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft)** - The analysis package developed by Brain Wandell's Vista Lab based in Matlab (with compiled portions) and optimized for surface analysis and vision science experiments. (From: VISTA Lab, Stanford)

***Other Useful MRI Software***

* **[NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net/)** - A repository for lots of neuroimaging software and an easy way to install many useful packages such as AFNI, FSL, etc.
* **[MriCron](http://people.cas.sc.edu/rorden/mricron/index.html)** - Probably the standard cross-platform NIfTI viewer. Also includes the dcm2nii converter.
* **[NeuroElf](http://neuroelf.net/)** - Excellent and powerful set of tools, functions, and a GUI interface that allows many formats of fMRI data to be imported and exported from Matlab. There are also tools for pre-processing and analysis. (Written and maintained by Jochen Weber at Columbia University.)
* **[3DSlicer](https://www.slicer.org/)** - Open source medical imaging file processing and visualization tool.
* **[MRIConvert](http://lcni.uoregon.edu/downloads/mriconvert)** - Powerful file format converter.
* **[Horos (Mac)](https://www.horosproject.org/)** - Excellent DICOM visualization and sorting tool based off the commercial OsiriX viewer.
* **[Mango](http://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/)** - Medical image viewer with analysis tools.
* **[FSL View](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslView)** - The viewer part of the FSL package that can also be used as a general viewer.
* **[BROCCOLI](https://github.com/wanderine/BROCCOLI)** - A set of pre-processing and analysis routines that are optimized for GPUs.


***Other Useful General Software***

* **[Cyberduck (Mac)](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en)** - Good SFTP GUI.
* **[Atom](https://atom.io/)** - Excellent text editor that is well integrated with GitHub.
* **[Git/GitHub](https://github.com/git)** - The standard for version tracking code (and other stuff) and making it publicly available.
* **[Slack](https://slack.com/)** - Very userful lab/workgroup message system.
* **[PathFinder (Mac)](https://cocoatech.com/)** - Excellent Finder replacement for OSX (because Finder is terrible). It allows sorting by extension, tabs, two pane file browsers, all the things you need to efficiently do science.
